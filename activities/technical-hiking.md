*Technical terrain at Massanella*

## Technical Hiking

An activity for experienced hikers. People who enjoy walking through oak forests, among carritx and the rocky peaks of the island. But maybe you don't feel comfortable with maps, narrow trails, or when you can't find the next cairn. I'd love to guide you on your next hike!

Do you want to hike up to all the peaks of Mallorca!?
