*For her, an unforgettable experience!*

## Discover Climbing

In Spanish we call this activity a climbing baptism as it has the magic of discovering a new activity!

I love helping others on their "first time", helping to create the best memories, both in your memory and pictures.

Bring the basic gear (climbing shoes and harness) and I'll take care of your first steps on natural rock. Whether you've been practicing for days or months in an indoor climbing gym or if you've never climbed before, you'll enjoy overcoming the new challenges of finding handholds and footholds. I'll take care of the ropes, safety, and encourage you to reach the top.
